    	<p>So, something that my elementary school did is that we’d have vocabulary words from our assigned readings, and we were supposed to go use them in a sentence to show that we understood what they meant. I, being me, naturally took this prompt to the next level and wrote a series of short stories about a wolf named Exasperated Wolf and his fairytale‐like adventures.</p>
